# Defend ZetaHQ!

This is a 2D grid-based tower defense game built with vanilla javascript. This is a late submission for the zetagames challenge and as such is still massively incomplete and unresponsive. However, there are plans to incorporate this to the zetachain testnet (mainnet in the future), make it responsive so that it can be enjoyed by PC users and mobile users alike, add a backend to store user scores all over the world and as such have a leaderboard so that users can have bragging rights. For best experience, Play this on a PC.
Update: It was too late (sigh).
